# Bethany J Aesthetics

Bethany J Aesthetics is a fully responsive website to advertise beauty services offered by a beauty salon in Cleckheaton, West Yorkshire UK. Featuring 4 main pages, A "Home" page an "About", "Gallery" and a "Contact Us" page.

The Website is to target both regular and brand new clients of Bethany J Aesthetics, with features to gain the confidence of new, potential clients.

## Colour Scheme

- Myself and the client worked together to come up with a colour scheme that would be modern, easy to read, and tasteful.
- The main colour used on the header, footer, and divs is a cool, light grey colour, I then used a pale blue gradient background to add a small amount of colour that tied in with the header and footer colour.
- Using a similar pale blue I created a hover Pseudo selector to draw attention to the nav links and buttons, then using the same colour I created an active class to underline the page in the nav bar that the user is currently on.

## Features

- ### Navigation bar

  - Featured on all three pages, this responsive navigation bar includes links to the "Home", "About" "Gallery" and "Contact Us" Pages. The navigation bar is featured identically on all 4 pages and allows users to navigate easily through the site.
  - CSS has been used here to make it clear to the user what page they are currently on by underlining the current page with a pale blue colour that ties in with the colour scheme.

- ### Landing page image
  - The landing includes a photograph of some attractive lips getting lip filler with a text overlay to allow the user to see straight away where they can book a free consultation.
  - The attractive photo gives the user an insight into the type of look they might want to achieve.

- ### Treatment Section- Section 2

  - Section 2 includes 3 side-by-side divs containing 3 different treatments available.
  - Each div contains photos with the names of the matching treatment on top to give the user an instant insight into the different treatments available.
  - The photos displayed also give the user an insight into what getting the treatment done might look like and the results they could achieve.

- ### Map and Review Section- Section 3
  - Section 3 includes 2 side by side divs, the 1st displaying an interactive map with a "where to find us" heading, a reviews div with the "Google 5-star review logo" at the top, and 3 individual reviews from Google inside a grey box.
  - The interactive map is an excellent way to instantly make users aware of the area/location the salon is located in.
  - The reviews section is an extremely good way to instantly build confidence and the "Google 5-star review logo" will reassure potential clients that might be visiting the site for the first time.

- ### The Footer

  - The footer contains all social media links with matching icons to encourage users to follow them and stay up to date.
  - A smaller logo is also located in the bottom left of the footer that when clicked will take the user back to the homepage in case the user might get lost.

- ### About page

  - The About page is intended to really connect with customers and to reassure them of their ethos and goals.
  - The Photo of the treatment room in the top left is to show the users what to expect when they go get their treatment done and familiarises them with the setting.
  - The Youtube short, embeded in the bottom right of the page gives users a virtual tour of the salon, this gives users an insite of what to expect when going to get a treatment done.

  - This page includes 2 main divs, the first being a form div allowing potential and interested clients to send through a detailed inquiry (with a large text box to allow clients to write a detailed inquiry including any past cosmetic procedures and what they're trying to achieve).
  - The right div contains the company phone number, email address, and location with matching font awesome icons to make it clear to the user what the information means.
